**PROJECT IN PROGRESS, NOT YET FINALIZED**

-----------------------------------------------
**PROJECT AKLATAN**<br>
**Introducing a way to automate Palawan National School's library system**

PNS Automated Library System is a proposed automated library management system for Palawan National School that automates the common library processes into one singular system to
move the entire library into digital system, which is more reliable and easier for both librarians and students. 

This project will be the first of an attempt to automate the entire library system the school uses, from the current analog and paper system with the intention to improve it's day to day function for both students and faculty. <br>
This project is also the first project for the programming subject by the Github user, who is under TVL-ICT specialization this 12th Grade in Palawan National School.

The project is only a part of series of attempting to move more school systems from manual processes to digital in order for faculty to save time in doing repetitive tasks 
and let them focus more on teaching and guiding the students.

**Proposed feature set**<br>
**A Windows 11, WinUI inspired library management dashboard for the librarian.**<br>

Inspired by WinUI Fluent Design in Windows 11, the new design will come along with familiar library management functions and will be present inside the new system
to make the librarians focus on what's more important by removing the most obstacles in manual library processses.

The image above is not indicative of the final product as it may or may not ship with the final release of the library system.
(All Genshin references and fan-arts linked to this, will be removed before official release and proper credits will be linked.)


**Batch book enrollment will make book inventory addition more effortless**<br>


With batch book enrollment, you can enroll boxes or catalogs of books either by a catalog file from the book publisher, or manual entry.


-----------------------------------------------
**Release schedule?**<br>
Since this is a project of the proponent, this undertaking will last until next year, where the first iterations will only start to be published to the general public.<br>
Right now, the entire project is only at the pre-development phase, where designing is still not finalized yet.

**Project Phase**
As of August 31 2022, the project is still on user interface design phase on Figma.
